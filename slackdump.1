.It
Authenticate in a new workspace using the
.Cm workspace
.Ar new

Run

, depending on your requirements.
.El
.Sh AUTHENTICATION
Slackdump supports multiple authentication methods, listed below.
.Ss Automatic login (EZ-LOGIN 3000)
This is the default authentication mode, and so far is the most convenient one.
It requires no additional configuration and works out of the box.  However, it
is not supported on all systems:  it requires GUI and x64 architecture, and may
require some additional steps on CentOS and other Redhat derived systems.

If the automatic login does not work for some reason, you can try to use one of
the manual login methods, described in the next section.

This method works on Single-Sign-On enabled workspaces as well in most cases.
.Ss Manual login methods
.Bl -tag -width token+cookie
.It Em token
This method requires Application
.Pq xoxa-
, Bot
.Pq xoxb-
or a Legacy
.Pq xoxp-
token. You can get these tokens (except Legacy) from the Slack
Workspace Administration page.  See the
.Lk https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types "Slack documentation"
for more details.
.Pp
.Sy Note:
You will not be able to access your DMs with the Application or Bot tokens, and
Legacy tokens are deprecated.
.It Em token+cookie
This is the pair of the Client Token
.Pq xoxc-
and a 
.Dq d=
Browser Cookie
.Pq xoxd=
value that you can get from your browser manually following the instructions in
the documentation.
.It Em token+cookie file
This is the same as above, but it requires the 
.Dq cookie.txt
file, exported from you Browser session in Mozilla format.  On Firefox, you could use
.Lk https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/ "Cookies.txt"
extension.
.Sy Note:
Some browser extensions may be unsafe and may expose your private data, so use them at
your own risk.  The authors of this utility do not endorse any of the
extensions mentioned above.
