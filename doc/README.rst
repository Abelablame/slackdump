Installation
------------

Installing is pretty simple - just download the latest Slackdump from the
Releases page, extract and run it.  More details are in the Installation_
section.

Logging in
----------
There are two types of login options available:

- Automatic_ (also called *EZ-Login 3000*); OR
- Manual_

Automatic_ login is the default one, it requires no prior setup, and the
general recommendation is to use the Automatic login.  If the Automatic login
doesn't work for some reason, fallback to Manual_ login steps.

Usage
-----
There are three modes of operation:

- `Listing users/channels`_
- `Dumping messages and threads`_ (private and public)
- `Creating a Slack Export`_
